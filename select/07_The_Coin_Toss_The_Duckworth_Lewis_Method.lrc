[00:30.19] Hello.
[00:33.14] Good morning. (Morning!)
[00:35.90] We're tossing a coin to begin.
[00:40.41] Duckworth go ahead.
[00:42.59] No Lewis; up to you.
[00:44.51] May the best man win,
[00:46.42] And may the best Duckworth lose.
[00:48.40] Let's begin.
[00:54.40] 
[00:57.73] It's heads,
[00:59.75] You called it.
[01:02.40] I think I'll go in for bat.
[01:05.83] And that's that.
