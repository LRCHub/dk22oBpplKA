[00:21.92] Say hello to the end and its big fucking jack-o-lantern grin
[00:32.89] Stay (how long) 'til the end and dilute the blood beneath my skin
[01:05.39] 
[01:02.16] Blackened nails and acumen
[01:06.72] Lacerated fists full of arrowheads
[01:12.63] Arid bones and hollow men
[01:17.05] Lie down on marrow beds
[01:28.55] 
[01:22.40] Say hello to the end and its open hand to pull you in
[01:32.01] Stay (how long) 'til the end beckons furlough floes to melt again
